# Polygon Creator Application (TESTING)

Simply load the .kmz file with the turbine locatoins ans set the number of points and buffer distance. 

The application will then create a polygon around the turbines and export the polygon as a .txt file and a .html file.

The .txt file contains the coordinates of the polygon and the .html file contains a map of the polygon.
